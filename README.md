About this project:

An AGI application has to be created using the PHP programming language.
The reason why PHP is a must is that the PBXware AGI is also written in PHP.
PHP AGI frameworks can be found and used as well.
The application should be a simple IVR which, when called, will play some greeting message, ask for a password if it is set (see Option 2) and then prompt the user to enter one of the three available options.
Option 1: A sound file that is played prompts the user to enter an Extension number.
          By entering an Extension number, a call is made to that Extension. (Ex. If ‘100’ is typed in, the Extension ‘100’ must be called).
          The user must not be able to call himself/herself. If the user tries to call himself/herself, a sound file should be played indicating an invalid action.

Option 2: A sound file that is played prompts the user to enter a password.  
          The password can be a 4-digit number. This password will be used next time the user enters the IVR.
          If the user already has a password set when choosing this option, then s(he) will need to enter his/her old password before changing it to a new one.
          If a wrong password is entered, a proper sound file should be played and the user will not be able to enter a new password.
          The new password will have to be entered twice for confirmation. 
          If the passwords do not match, a proper sound file should be played.
          A sound file should also be played on a successful password set/change.

Option 3: Choosing this option will do a loopback as if the IVR was just called. 
          The greeting message will be played again and one of the options can be chosen again.
